<p>In this course, we focus on statistical inference techniques and their applications. Inference allows us to learn about unobserved quantities from observed data based on a probability model. For example, we can infer the evolutionary relationships between organisms based on their genomic sequence data and a probability model of evolutionary changes. We will consider both frequentist and Bayesian methods, but will focus on the latter which aims to combine existing information with new observations in a statistically consistent manner. A main component of the course is computational methods that make possible Bayesian analysis of large datasets, which are common in many engineering and scientific disciplines, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, computational biology, and statistical physics.</p>

<p>Structure: The first two thirds of the course will consist of lectures. In the last third, enough time will be devoted to project presentations and the rest will be instructor lectures.</p>

<p>Activities: The homework will consist of problems and programming exercises. There will also be a final course project which will either involve data analysis of a real dataset to gain new insights or explores developing new inference approaches.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: Standard linear algebra and calculus; Probability theory (briefly reviewed); A basic understanding of molecular biology is helpful but not necessary.</p>
