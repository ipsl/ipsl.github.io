# Welcome to Mathematics of Information

This course focuses on the mathematical foundations needed to understand the principles governing the storage, processing, and transmission of information (on any device). It will allow us, for example, to gain an understanding of 
* How does a cellphone, which has mostly digital components, interact with an analog world?
* How does it store different types of data (music, video, apps) reliably, when the storage device itself (flash memory) is unreliable? 
* What makes it possible to stream music over noisy wireless channels that sound so good (well, most of the time)?
