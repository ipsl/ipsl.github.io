development notes
- links in moi that refer to the parent webpage should be preceded by .. e.g., ../teaching.html
- moi uses the same top navigation bar (with links altered as above). The nav bar is in course-moi.html and should be updated from page.html from the parent webpage
- moi uses home.css from the parent web page. That file should be copied here whenever it is changed
