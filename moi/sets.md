# Sets and set theory
In this section, we will briefly review the basics of set theory, given their use in the rest of the course.

## Sets
A **set** is a *well-determined*, *logically consistent* collection of distinct objects, for example, the set of all teapots, or prime numbers less than 100.

**Set theory** is the mathematical language for describing sets and operations on them.

We usually use "{" and "}" to enclose the elements of a set. Sets are usually unordered, so the set {dime, quarter} is the same as the set {quarter, dime}. If $$x$$ is in $$A$$, we say that it is a *member* of $$A$$ and write $$x\in A$$. 


Some examples:
* The set of prime numbers less than 10: $$\{2,3,5,7\}$$ 
* The set of *natural numbers*: $$\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\dotsc\}$$
* The set of my favorite TV shows: {futurama, psych, breaking bad}
* The set of the first 13 letters of the English alphabet. 
* The set of even numbers: $$\{x\in\mathbb{N}: \exists k\in \mathbb N, x=2k\}$$.  This last one needs a bit of unpacking. 
    - What appears on the right of : restricts what appears on the left via some condition. 
    - $$\exists$$ is read as "there exists." 
    - So you can read the expression as the set of all natural numbers $$x$$ for which there exists a natural number $$k$$ such that $$x=2k$$.

*Why study set theory?* We study sets because they are foundational in mathematics. Also, information can be described as identifying a state among a *set* of possible states. Information is also closely related to probability, for which we again need sets. Finally, sets will be helpful in understanding analog and digital signals.

### Defining sets
To define a set, we can list its elements explicitly, e.g., $$A=\{1,3,5,7,9\}$$. We can also define a set as the collection of objects satisfying a precise property, e.g., the set of "positive odd integers". For any object $$x$$, we can determine whether or not it is a positive odd integer, so this property defines a set. 

If the property is vague or logically inconsistent, it cannot be used to define a set:
* A = "The set of tall students in this class". Is Jacob in this set? Being tall is not defined precisely, and so the set is ambiguous.
* B = "Set of all objects not in the B‚Äù. Is 5 in the set, or is it not? For a given element, to check if it satisfies the property, we already need to know what B is.

<h3> <span class="note_emoji"></span>Naive Set Theory</h3>
<p>Our approach to set theory is called <strong>naive set theory</strong>. Naive set theory assumes that any precisely defined property can be used to define a set. This seemingly straightforward assumption leads to contradictions!</p>
 
<p><strong>Russell‚Äôs paradox:</strong> For any set, we can determine if it satisfies the property of being a member of itself. For example, \(A=\{A,2,7\}\) satisfies it but \(B=\{2,7\}\) does not. So let us define a set based on it: "Let \(R\) be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves". Is \(R\) a member of \(R\)?</p>

<p>Another way to illustrate the same paradox: Suppose a barber shaves all and only those who do not shave themselves. Does the barber shave himself? </p>

## Sets: relationships and operations

* Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same members: ùê¥=ùêµ
* Set $$A$$ contains set $$B$$ if all the elements of $$B$$ are members of $$A$$. This is written as $$B\subseteq A$$
* If $$A$$ contains $$B$$, and $$A$$ is contained in $$B$$, then $$A$$ and $$B$$ are equal.
* The *empty set* is the set with no elements. It is shown by: $$\varnothing$$. For any other set $$A$$, we have $$\varnothing\subseteq A$$.
* The universal set contains absolutely everything (where we get to define what everything is). It is shown by $$U$$. For any other set $$A$$, we have $$A\subseteq U$$.
* The complementary set, or complement, of a set is the set of everything that is not in the set. For a set $$A$$, its complement is shown by $$A^c$$. That is, $$A^c = \{x:x\not\in A\}.$$

### Set operations:
* Intersection: Elements that are in both $$A$$ and $$B$$: $$A\cap B = \{x:x\in A, x\in B\}$$.
* Union: Elements that are in $$A$$, in $$B$$, or in both: $$A\cup B = \{x:x\in A \text{ or }  x\in B\}$$.
* Difference: Elements that are in $$A$$ but not in $$B$$: $$A\setminus B = \{x:x\in A, x\not\in B\}$$.
  - Note: $$A\setminus B = A\cap B^c$$.
